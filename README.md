JDBC Adapter is the [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) adapter for [jCasbin](https://github.com/casbin/jcasbin). With this library, jCasbin can load policy from JDBC supported database or save policy to it.

Based on [Supported JDBC Drivers and Databases](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19226-01/820-7688/gawms/index.html), The currently supported databases are:

- MySQL
- Java DB
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- DB2
- Sybase
- Microsoft SQL Server

## Installation

For Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.casbin</groupId>
  <artifactId>jdbc-adapter</artifactId>
  <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

**Notice:** 

Since version 2.0.2, jdbc-adapter adds an ``id`` field to the database table structure by default. 

If you want to upgrade to 2.0.2 - 2.2.0, you have to add the ``id`` field manually. It is recommended to add the ``id`` field. If you don't want to add the ``id`` field, please use 2.2.1+.

## Oracle driver

The Oracle JDBC driver is not redistributable, so this adapter does not pull it
in as a dependency. Oracle support in the adapter itself is unchanged:
applications using Oracle obtain a driver matching their Java and database
versions from [Oracle JDBC downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html),
review its terms, and add it to their own runtime classpath. Then pass the
configured `javax.sql.DataSource` to `new JDBCAdapter(dataSource)`, or use the
driver-name/URL constructor. Applications using other databases need no extra
driver, and the automated MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server tests do not need Oracle.

## Simple Example

```java
package com.company.test;

import org.casbin.adapter.JDBCAdapter;
import org.casbin.jcasbin.main.Enforcer;
import com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource;

public class Test {
    public static void main() {
        String driver = "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver";
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name";
        String username = "root";
        String password = "123456";

        // The adapter will use the table named "casbin_rule".
        // Use driver, url, username and password to initialize a JDBC adapter.
        JDBCAdapter a = new JDBCAdapter(driver, url, username, password); 
        
        // Recommend use DataSource to initialize a JDBC adapter.
        // Implementer of DataSource interface, such as hikari, c3p0, durid, etc.
        MysqlDataSource dataSource = new MysqlDataSource();
        dataSource.setURL(url);
        dataSource.setUser(username);
        dataSource.setPassword(password);

        a = JDBCAdapter(dataSource);        

        Enforcer e = new Enforcer("examples/rbac_model.conf", a);

        // Check the permission.
        e.enforce("alice", "data1", "read");

        // Modify the policy.
        // e.addPolicy(...);
        // e.removePolicy(...);

        // Save the policy back to DB.
        e.savePolicy();
        // Close the connection.
        a.close();
    }
}
```

## Incubation status

Apache Casbin (Incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
